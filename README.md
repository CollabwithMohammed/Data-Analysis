Jobs Data Analysis

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of job market trends using a dataset that includes various job postings. The primary goal is to uncover insights into the demand for different skills, salary trends, and the geographic distribution of job opportunities. By employing data cleaning and visualization techniques, I utilized libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze the data effectively. Key findings include the most sought-after skills in the current job market, the average salary range for various positions, and how these factors vary across regions. This analysis not only highlights critical industry trends but also provides valuable information for job seekers and employers alike. The complete code and visualizations are available in this repository, allowing others to replicate or build upon this work
